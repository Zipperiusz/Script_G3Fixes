# Details  
#### New, more random percentage chance for applying status effects like Freeze or Burn on hit
- Spells:  
  Area spells or charged spells have 100% to apply effect  
  Quick casted spells have 10% chance to apply effect (optional, QuickCastChance in config)  
- Melee:  
  Normal attacks have 30% chance to apply  
  Power attacks have 35% chance to apply  
- Ranged:  
  Based on the bow's tension force  
#### Companions that are following Hero will now attack enemies immediately when Hero or other companion is targeted and attacked.
This feature can be toggled on/off with a hotkey while in-game (default: APOSTROPHE)  
  
There is an icon added in top right corner of the screen representing current status.  
Green shield - standard, vanilla game behaviour, companions are more passive  
Red clashing swords - new behaviour, companions are more aggressive  
Icon is only visible when there are companions in Hero's party.  
  
Icon size and position can be changed in config  
  
CompanionIconSize - Size of the icon (default: 16)  
CompanionIconPosTopX - Position in X-axis in percentage (default: 98.5, min: 0.0, max: 100.0)  
CompanionIconPosTopY - Position in Y-axis in percentage (default: 2.5, min: 0.0, max: 100.0)  
#### Companions will now use sprint when following Hero  
#### Companions that are too far away from Hero will be teleported near Hero, distance for this check is Entity.ROI - 250.0  
(optional, TeleportCompanionTooFarAway in config)  
#### If Player cancels routine of an NPC (by walking into the room or drawing a weapon) that is using interactive objects like beds, bookstands, NPC will try to take a few steps back and free the object, so Hero can use it now  
#### Added console command for reviving NPCs  
  `revive NPC_INSTANCE` or simply `revive` when dead NPC is focused (it can only be focused if corpse was not looted yet)  
#### Added console command for resetting NPCs position  
  `resetpos NPC_INSTANCE` or simply `resetpos` when NPC is focused and not dead  
  NPC should be teleported to the destination point of their current routine  
#### Fully integrated Script_ItemUseFuncEnabler  
This feature is for mod developers, example modified working templates for Cure Disease and Antidote are included in optional zip file  
#### Added an option to remove all waterfall sound effects from the game  
Due to a bug with sound effects system, when near big waterfalls near Silden, game can get a bit laggy (for me itâ€™s almost unplayable there).  
Until a proper fix for that issue is found, I created this workaround.  
(RemoveWaterfallSoundEffects in config, by default turned off)  
#### Added an option to block monster respawn  
Some monsters can respawn after few in-game days after being killed, this script prevents that  
(optional, BlockMonsterRespawn in config, by default turned off)  
# Installation  
Extract Script_G3Fixes.zip inside main directory of Gothic 3 (where Gothic3.exe is placed).  
  
If you want Cure Disease potion and Antidote to work without that stupid spell animation, extract also Script_G3Fixes_Example_Templates.zip inside main directory.
